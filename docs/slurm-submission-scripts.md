# Slurm 

*Slurm* is a resource scheduler for HPC Clusters.

Slurm submission scripts are how you ask for resources on the cluster and what to do with those resources once you get them.

I have a collection of different examples I have used.
Its stored on [GitHub - Charles Forsyth](https://github.com/CharlesForsyth/slurm_scripts).
