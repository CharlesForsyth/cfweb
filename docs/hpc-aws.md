## AWS

High Performance Computing in the Cloud with AWS.

* This is work I have done at the High Performance Compiting Center at the University of Calforina, Riverside.

### Introduction

Getting started using HPCC and Amazon Web Service (AWS) to quickly create an on-demand cluster private to you.

### AWS Cluster benefits.

* Build a private cluster in 10 min.
  * Any number of nodes, auto scaling (up and down), limit 20 to start
  * Any type of compute nodes
    * High memory
    * High CPU single/multi node
    * GPUs
* For only as long as you need it - delete when done
* Familiar interface and job scheduler
* Build as many of these clusters as you need (even at the same time)
* Pay for only the time you use it - per/min billing
